<p>Hi! My name is Wentao (he/him), and I study human-centered security and privacy, advised by <a href="https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~mmazurek/" target="_blank">Michelle Mazurek</a>. My research focuses on unlocking the power of professionals to protect users' security and privacy. During my PhD so far, I have studied how tech product reviewers evaluate the security and privacy of the devices they write about; how scientists approach the challenging task of de-identifying sensitive data; and how experts tailor security and privacy advice for individuals facing heightened risks.</p>

<p>Previously, I have done research on privacy policy visualization (computer science), deepfakes (history and philosophy), and narratives shaping settler colonialism in the American Midwest (digital humanities).</p>

<p>I am also a climate advocate (currently serving on College Park's Committee for a Better Environment), swimmer, and musician (currently in the UMD choirs).</p>
