<p>Hi! My name is Wentao (he/him), and I study human-centered security and privacy, advised by <a href="https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~mmazurek/" target="_blank">Michelle Mazurek</a>. I study the mental models, practices, and challenges of professionals including software developers, tech product reviewers, and social scientists, and I design useful and thought-provoking tools to help them. I am on the academic job market!</p>

<p>Outside of computer science, I have researched deepfakes (as a historian and philosopher) and narratives shaping settler colonialism in the American Midwest (as a digital humanities scholar).</p>

<p>I am also a climate advocate (currently serving on College Park's Committee for a Better Environment), swimmer, and musician.</p>
